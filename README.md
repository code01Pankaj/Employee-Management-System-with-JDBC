# Employee-Management-System-with-JDBC
This code implements an Employee Management System using Java Database Connectivity (JDBC) to interact with an Oracle database. The system allows users to perform various operations such as adding employees, viewing all employees, viewing employee details by ID, updating employee details by ID, and deleting employees by ID. The program demonstrates the use of prepared statements for database operations and handles user input using a switch-case structure within a loop.
